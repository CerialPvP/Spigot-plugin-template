# Spigot Plugin Template
This is a plugin template I made for people who want to make plugins without setting up Maven for 2 hours.

## How to use?
All you need to do, is to clone this repository, and then you can use it!

Make sure to change some information in the pom.xml, you almost don't need to change anything in the Spigot plugin.yml as most of the information is taken from the pom.xml.

If you are using VSCode as an IDE, then make sure to download Maven and a JDK.

## How to compile?

To compile, all you need to do is `mvn clean` and `mvn package`.
